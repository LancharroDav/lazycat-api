This is a demo of the original project.

#### Description

Easy-to-use Bookmark manager where you can setup your own presets to open many links with one click, saving time to start your journey.

#### Notes

Rack-cors is set up to accept only requests from 'localhost:3000/...' in development.

For production you need to set it up in '../config/initializers/cors.rb'
