This is a demo of the original project.

Rack-cors is set up to accept only requests from 'localhost:3000/...' in development.

For production you need to set it up in '../config/initializers/cors.rb'

Feel free to fork it, make your versions or whatever you want, JUST REMEMBER TO MENTION MY GITHUB PROFILE ;)
